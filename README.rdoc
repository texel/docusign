== Description

A library for communicating with the Docusign API via SOAP.

== Making An API Call

  connection = Docusign::Base.login(
    :integrators_key  => 'your_integrators_key',
    :email            => 'your_user_name',
    :password         => 'your_password',
    :endpoint_url     => 'http://demo.docusign.net/API/3.0/dsapi.asmx'
  )

  connection.request_status :envelope_id => '12345'

== Install

1. $ gem update --system (this is only necessary if you don't have rubygems 1.3.6 or newer)
2. $ gem install docusign

== AutoCamelize

The Docusign gem supports calling methods using both camelCase and snake_case. Methods in snake_case
that don't exist on a Docusign module class or instance are automatically aliased to their camelCase
equivalent, if one exists. Hence, the following two examples are functionally identical:

  connection.request_status :envelopeID => '12345'
  connection.requestStatus :envelopeID => '12345'

== Builder syntax

To ease common tasks, some builder methods are included. For example, you can generate tabs for a
document for a particular recipient from the document itself:

  recipient = Docusign::Recipient.new # You may want to set some attributes of the recipient as well.
  document  = Docusign::Document.new

  tabs = document.tabs recipient do |d|
    d.tab :name => 'email', :value => email, :page => 1, :x => 190, :y => 186
    d.tab :name => 'phone', :value => phone, :anchor => {:string => 'Phone:',  :x_offset => 200, :y_offset => -2}
    d.tab :type => Docusign::TabTypeCode::FullName, :page => 1, :x => 190, :y => 118
  end
  
These tabs will be pre-populated with both the document's and recipient's id.
Note that passing in a recipient to the builder is optional- you can still specify or override the recipient
for an individual tab:

  tabs = document.tabs do |d|
    d.tab :recipient => signer_1, :name => 'email', :value => email, :page => 1, :x => 190, :y => 186
    d.tab :recipient => signer_2, :name => 'email', :value => email, :page => 1, :x => 190, :y => 186
  end
  
You can also use block syntax for the tabs themselves:

  tabs = document.tabs recipient do |d|
    d.tab do |t|
      t.name = 'phone'
      t.anchor do |a|
        a.string = 'Phone'
        a.x_offset = 200
      end
    end
  end
